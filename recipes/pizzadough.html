    <p>Easy scratch-made pizza dough.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/5 cups warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups all purpose or bread flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix warm water and 1/2 teaspoon sugar; add yeast and whisk until dissolved. Let stand until bubbles form on surface.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk flour, salt, remaining 1 teaspoon sugar and, if desired, dried herbs. Make a well in center; add yeast mixture and oil. Stir until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead, adding more flour to surface as needed until no longer sticky and dough is smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place in a large greased bowl; turn once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes; transfer bowl to refrigerator and chill overnight. Allow dough to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes, before rolling.</li>
        </ol>
